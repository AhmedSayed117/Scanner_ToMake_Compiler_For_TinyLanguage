Write a program in C++ that implements the scanning(Tokenization) step of a custom compiler built to compile the TINY programming language 

Program input: The scanner will take a source code file written in the TINY programming language as an input; You can find an example of an input file in the file called `input.txt`  


Program output: The scanner should output a text file that contains the tokens found in the input file with each token represented on a single line in the following format 
[number of line the token was found in starting from 1 in square brackets] [the actual string that represents the token in the input file] [a string that represents the token type in round brackets] 


example for an output file:
[1] if (If)
[1] x (ID)
[2] 200 (Num) 
...

TINY language rules:
sequence of statements separated by ;
Comments {}
I/O read write
math expressions integers only, + - * / ^
boolean only in if and repeat conditions < = and two mathematical expressions
repeat-statement: repeat until (boolean)
if-statement: if (boolean) then [else] end
variable names can include only alphabetic characters(a:z or A:Z) and underscores
variables are declared simply by assigning values to them :=
all variables are integers
no procedures - no declarations
Notes:
You may or may not use all or some of the utility methods found in the file `CompilersTask_1_Scanner.cpp` to help you implement the required scanner
The assignment should be done in pairs maximum
Cheating cases will be graded negatively
